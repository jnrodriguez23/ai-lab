**Code experiments and technical prototypes for understanding, using, and extending Large Language Models (LLMs).**

---

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose

This directory contains scripts and notebooks that explore the internal mechanics of LLMsâ€”from tokenization and prompt structure to fine-tuning logic and embedding analysis.

It serves as the technical counterpart to the `prompts/` folder, offering hands-on exploration of how LLMs interpret, process, and generate language.

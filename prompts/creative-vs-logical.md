### 🧠 Prompt 2: Logical Deduction Puzzle

**Prompt:**  
> Three people—Alice, Bob, and Carol—are wearing hats. Each can see the others' hats but not their own. There are two red hats and one blue hat. They are told this fact and asked, one at a time, if they know the color of their own hat. Simulate their reasoning and determine who figures it out first.

**Context / Notes:**  
- Target: Logic puzzle enthusiasts / educators
- Goal: Assess logical step-by-step deduction
- Model: GPT-4  
- Format: Step-by-step deduction with justification

**Results / Observations:**

### 🔁 Prompt 3: Switch Between Modes

**Prompt:**  
> First, write a short poem about entropy. Then, explain the concept of entropy in thermodynamics as if teaching it to a physics undergrad.

**Context / Notes:**  
- Target: Advanced students / dual-mode evaluation
- Goal: Evaluate range between creative expression and scientific clarity
- Model: GPT-4  
- Format: Section 1 = Poem, Section 2 = Scientific explanation

**Results / Observations:**  
✅ Demonstrates strong versatility in tone and content  
🟡 Sometimes poetic metaphors bleed into the technical section

### ⚖️ Prompt 4: Compare Two Reasoning Styles

**Prompt:**  
> Describe what happens during a lunar eclipse in two ways: first, as a poetic metaphor; second, as a scientific explanation.

**Context / Notes:**  
- Target: Teachers, instructional designers
- Goal: Highlight difference in explanatory styles
- Model: GPT-4  
- Format: Side-by-side dual paragraph

**Results / Observations:**  
✅ Provides contrast in tone and focus  
🟡 Occasionally mixes metaphors into scientific section

### 🌀 Prompt 5: Creative Use of Logic

**Prompt:**  
> Imagine you're an alien AI trying to understand human humor. Write a hypothesis about why humans laugh, based on logic and observed behavior.

**Context / Notes:**  
- Target: Experimental / advanced use
- Goal: Blend creative premise with logical framing
